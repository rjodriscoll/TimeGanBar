# TimeGanBar

In this analysis I investigate the potential of a gan approach (TimeGAN) to generate multivariate accelerometer readings and paired blood alcohol. 

The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic data. In many cases, the amount of data available to researchers is small, and collecting additional data is far too expensive. GANs have emerged in recent years as a potential means to overcome this issue. 

The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In brief, the dataset consists of Accelerometer and transdermal alcohol content data from a college bar crawl and the data was originally used to predict heavy drinking episodes via mobile data. 


The notebook Time_gan_run.ipynb showes the preprocessing and GAN training steps. Inspect_output.ipynb investigates the results.
